#### Keeping the boogy man away from your code!


Specter is a Python testing framework inspired from RSpec and Jasmine. Specter is rather new and under active development. 
While I encourage people to work with and contribute to the project, please keep in mind that this library is a growing and may change a bit in the future depending on the community's needs.
